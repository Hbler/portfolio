    "part1": "This year I decided to deepen my connection with technology and recently concluded a Full-Stack certification course of 2.000 hours, in which I experienced many aspects of a real professional environment, developing with deadlines, agile methodology, working with and managing teams, and also as a coach for peers.",
    "part2": "As is characteristic of the tech field, I still have things to learn about, but since we were introduced to new techs and concepts bimonthly in the course, I developed my capacity to learn quickly. As a ‘scientist’ I’m motivated by experimenting and learning with the new and the traditional to figure out the best ways to achieve goals and solve problems.",
    "part3": "And since learning became a habit I’m still studying in other courses and books to learn other programming languages and deepen some concepts like TDD (test driven development), common algorithms, data structures, and design patterns.",
